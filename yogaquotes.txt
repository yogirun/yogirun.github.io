In order to achieve a state of yoga, one must develop both practice and detachment.

—Yoga Sutra I.1



The Yoga system of Patanjali is known as the Eightfold Path. 
1. Yama (moral conduct), - Yama is fulfilled by noninjury to others, truthfulness, nonstealing, continence, and non-covetousness. 
2. Niyama (religious observances). The niyama prescripts are purity of body and mind, contentment in all circumstances, self-discipline, 
self-study (contemplation), and devotion to God and guru.
 3. Asana (right posture); the spinal column must be held straight, 
and the body firm in a comfortable position for meditation;
 4. Pranayama (control of prana, subtle life currents); and 
 5. Pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses from external objects). The last steps are forms of yoga proper:
 6. Dharana (concentration), holding the mind to one thought; 
7. Dhyana (meditation); 
and 8. Samadhi (superconscious experience). -- Read more: http://yogananda.com.au/patanjali/yoga_sutras00.html
